# Orientation Estimator

## Lessons from trials

- state: (global vel, global acc, global ori), measurement: (local_acc) setup:

change acceleartion and orientation at the same time (rotating a body and choose incorrect acceleration state)to satisfy the measurement instead of correcting orientation with vertical direction.
